* How To Use

  First, make sure the repository is in the =bashtools= directory off
  of =$HOME=. Then stick the following into =$HOME/.profile= and log
  in again.

#+begin_src shell-script
  # Set to 1 for verbose, or 0 for quiet.
  VERBOSE=1
  
  if [ -d "$HOME/bashtools" ]
  then
      for file in "$HOME/bashtools/"*.sh
      do
          test 1 -eq $VERBOSE && echo -n "Loading $file ... "
          source $file
          test 1 -eq $VERBOSE && echo "done"
      done
  fi
#+end_src

* Stuff That Isn't Mine

  There is some code here that isn't really mine. Most notably,
  =cabal.sh= was copied from [[https://www.haskell.org/cabal/][The Haskell Cabal]]. Little snippets here
  and there were probably picked up from coworkers, fellow hackers,
  and shell-scripting weirdos along the way.

  As a result, I can't really claim a license on any of this stuff. Is
  that bad? I'm not sure. Just take a look, learn from it, and use
  this code to do other cool things with your favorite shell.
